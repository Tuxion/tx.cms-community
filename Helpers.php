    # The Helpers.php file
    
    This is where you define helper functions.
    Helpers are used to make common operations easier for programmers to implement.
    If you find yourself copying the same pieces of code over and over again
    you probably want to make a function here to easily maintain your code.
    
    Call a helper using:
      tx('Component')->helpers('component_name')->call('function_name' array($arguments));
